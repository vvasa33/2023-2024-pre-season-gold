Tutorial:

Our team has used a mix of the FtcRobotController along with the Android Studio Platform in order
to build our opModes for competition. Please don't use blocks or onBotJava, they're not very good
and they make the team look bad.

How it works:
Let's start from the top. Make sure your Control Hub and Driver Hub are both updated to the latest 
firmware and that you have downloaded the FtcRobotController app and loaded it into Android Studio.

Your code will go into the TeamCode folder, just go through the file hierarchy until you get to the 
readme.md file and make a Java file in that. 

Start:

You can check out our code, but you'll need some experience with the Java programming language in
order to understand what's going on.

Ok?
