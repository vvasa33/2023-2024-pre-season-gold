FTC Robocavs Gold (#8479) Repository for the 2023-2024 Centerstage Season
Written by: Visu Vasa
Team: Visu Vasa (captain + programmer), Michael Shonting (main builder + cad), Jasper Krantz (builder + freshman), Elizabeth Wolff (president + builder), Hayden Winters (vice president + builder)
Everyone is a senior except for Jasper who is a freshman 

Features:
- Road Runner Integration with 3-wheel Deadwheel Odometry system for accurate autonomous robotic navigation
	- C++ addition might be made soon, if it's not completed by the end of the season I'll create a separate repo and share it with the robocavs gold account
- Subsystem hierarchy for grouping hardware interfaces and code organization
- 2 camera vision system for AprilTag detection, pose managment used in conjunction with roadrunner systems to maintain accuracy when moving
- Cool thing in auto that allows us to choose our routes during auto in order to cater to the autos of other teams and maximize points scored and effective robot placement for TeleOp
- Finite State Machine used to determine state and account for all possibilites of our robot in a certain scenario. Used for accuracy and to allow for multitasking within autonomous and TeleOp routines

Future Teams
Please don't make any changes to the actual code in the repository. Once our season is over, I'd like to keep this as reference for future teams to use the code.
